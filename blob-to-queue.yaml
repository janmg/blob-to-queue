## GENERIC CONFIG
# if fsnotify is set to true at the start of the program, changes will take affect on save on a running instance, if the program started without or set to false the program must be restarted to take affect

## INPUT CONFIG
# read from blob storage, default format is "json",
# TODO implement jsonlines, csv, line, regexp parser when everything else works. This program is initially for nsgflowlog parsing.

# Because golang does not support "infinite" channels, we set a maximum size for the queue. The watermark is the size until we stop reading in more data, the difference between qsize and qwatermark should be the amount of events that can be stored in a single file.

## FILTER CONFIG
# not implemented, this program came from logstash-input-azure_blob_storage, to be used to filter logs independantly.


## OUTPUT CONFIG
# The formatter can output as original "line", as "csv"
# setting an output will enable the output immediately after saving the file, because fsnotify will read the changes and apply them on the fly.
# format can be csv, flat, ecs, avro
